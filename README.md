#### Project Introduction

In the realm of small business financing in the United States, the mission of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has been pivotal since its establishment in 1953. By promoting and supporting small enterprises within the U.S. credit market, the SBA has played a crucial role in fostering job creation and reducing unemployment.

One of the SBA's key initiatives is its loan guarantee program, designed to incentivize banks to extend loans to small businesses. Acting as an insurance provider, the SBA mitigates the risk for banks by guaranteeing a portion of the loan amount. In the event of a loan default, the SBA steps in to cover the guaranteed portion.

Despite SBA loans guaranteeing only a portion of the loan balance, banks still face the dilemma of whether to grant such loans, given the risk of default. Analyzing historical data becomes a valuable tool for informed decision-making in this context.

#### Project Objective

The primary business challenge is to determine if a loan can be granted with reasonable confidence that the borrowing company will repay it without significant issues.

#### Key Business Questions

- What defines companies that best predict loan repayment or potential problems?
- Does a company's history of multiple loans impact the likelihood of encountering repayment issues?
- How do the lending bank and credit line influence loan repayment?
- Is there a correlation between the loan term, the year the loan was issued, and repayment success?

#### Analytical Approach

Our objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a company may face difficulties in loan repayment, simplistically referred to as a "defaulted loan." This data science project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and is developed using technical tools like Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and more.
