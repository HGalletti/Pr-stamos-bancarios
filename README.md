  Business Problem
  
Commercial context and motivation

The U.S. SBA (United States Small Business Administration) was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market.

Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. One way SBA assists these small business enterprises is through a loan guarantee program which is designed to encourage banks to grant loans to small businesses. SBA acts much like an insurance provider to reduce the risk for a bank by taking on some of the risk through guaranteeing a portion of the loan. In the case that a loan goes into default, SBA then covers the amount they guaranteed.

There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans. The rate of default on these loans has been a source of controversy for decades. Conservative economists believe that credit markets perform efficiently without government participation. Supporters of SBA- guaranteed loans argue that the social benefits of job creation by those small businesses receiving government- guaranteed loans far outweigh the costs incurred from defaulted loans.

Since SBA loans only guarantee a portion of the entire loan balance, banks will incur some losses if a small business defaults on its SBA-guaranteed loan. Therefore, banks are still faced with a difficult choice as to whether they should grant such a loan because of the high risk of default. One way to inform their decision making is through analyzing relevant historical data such as the datasets provided here.

Target

The business problem is to decide if a loan can be granted, with a reasonable probability that the requesting company can cancel it without inconvenience.

Business Target

What are the characteristics of the companies that best predict whether or not the company will have problems repaying the loan? What happens if a company takes several loans, is it more likely that one will have problems? How does the borrowing bank and the line of credit influence? Is there a relationship with the term of the loan? And with the year the loan was made? (Let's keep in mind that this last question is related to the economic and political context.).

Context and analytical approach

The aim is to implement a machine learning model that, with the different values of the dataset fields, predicts if the company had difficulties in paying the loan, which can be called in a shorter way as "defaulted loan".
